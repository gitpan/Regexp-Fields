Regexp::Fields version 0.42
===========================

Regexp::Fields adds the "(?<name> ...)" extended pattern to Perl's
regular expression language.  This works like an ordinary pair of
capturing parens, but after a match you can use $&{name} instead of
$1 (or whichever $N) to access the captured value.
